Hi, guys, my name is Karthik and I am from the Dotcom, and welcome to another video of Internet automation
testing of Cyprus course.
And in this video, we are going to talk about the Kasparov's the testing with Cyprus.
So Kasparov's the testing.
It's finally there.
The highly anticipated support for Firefox and the new Microsoft Edge browser in Cyprus 4.0 is added.
And this capability is added in such a way that it can run Cyprus test in Firefox, Microsoft Chrome
browser in any editions that you are looking for.
So Cyprus 4.0 marks a significant milestone in the development of Cyprus and sets a stage for an exciting
pipeline of capabilities that will continue to elevate the testing experience for everyone.
And again, I just copied this text from the Cyprus website, from the release page, and it's really
worth it because I don't really want to replicate the different wordings for this.
I could see that Cyprus is one of the most significant milestone for the Cyprus itself, because we
have been talking about Cyprus inability for the crossroads agisting, except that it only supports
the chrom as well as the electron browser, which was kind of pain because people were thinking that
they cannot do any Kasparov's the testing support all these days.
But right now they can do the browser testing as well.
Recently, a couple of days before I spoke about Cyprus in the Cyprus workshop, and I could see that
people were kind of getting frustrated without the support of cross-border testing.
But right now, this feature is going to add the ability to run the test, not just in one browser,
which is chrome or electron, rather, we can now run our test in Firefox.
Any additions like developer additions that night, Liburd or the full version of Firefox?
Or we could also run the test on its browser with different editions as well.
Similarly, so running the test with different browsers in Cyprus.
Is Verita easier than how you do it with the electron or the Chrome browser earlier?
If you're going to run the test in the Cyprus dashboard, it's going to look something like this.
As you can see, that is this chrome and edge displayed over here.
You can see that at the edge, different versions like Edge 81, and that is Edge SEVENTY-NINE, which
is the full version and similar against electron and the chromium.
But you can see that I don't really see the Firefox for some reason in the Windows machine that I have
right now.
I'm not very sure about it.
Maybe this is a new edition, or maybe I still have to do some sort of configuration for making the
Firefox to be available.
But if I do the same thing in Mac operating system, I can see Firefox browser, but not the browser,
which is kind of crazy.
But I could see that the support is already there in Cyprus and I could run the test on these different
browser.
But for some reason, maybe my configuration is wrong, or maybe we should wait for some more time for
the Cyprus to be solidifying why the browser is not displayed in all the different machines.
Cross my finger.
It will surely support all the browsers and not run the different browsers in different scripting versions.
You can do something like this so you can just do a cycle and run on chrome to run the Chrome browser.
And similarly for the Firefox browser, you can specify something like that.
So basically the cycle and run column Firefox is more like a tag to initiate the actual command that
you have written on the right hand side.
And then if you want to run the browser just from the command line, like one browser, you can do something
like this.
And this is the one that we have been talking about in this course.
And yes, this is how you can actually run the browser like Edge browser much, much simpler.
So instead of Mauceri, let's get started and action and understand how things work and see how Cyprus
runs the test in cross browser platforms.
All right, let's get started.
All right.
So this is the Udemy Cyperus project that we have been talking all these days in this course.
And you can see that we have the cross browser support being added for the Cyprus 4.0.
And you can see that we are currently using the Cyprus throughout a doctrine here, but the latest version
is 4.0.
So if I just just remove this guy and put it up, of course I need control space.
You can see that Microsoft Beatles record is fetching the latest version of package, which is 4.0.
So I can just use this and save it.
And, you know, we can do and npm update for doing that.
So I can just do an update which will update the Cyprus to the latest version, which is nothing but
from thirty eight to 4.0 all the way.
Right.
So it is updated right now.
And now if I go back to my node modules and if I go all the way to the Cyprus and there is this package
that is on file, if it says it is Cyprus 4.0, which means it is the latest version that we have already
installed within our project.
All right.
Now, everything is already here.
So I'm gonna do is I'm going to run the existing test, which we have already done in this course,
which is very, very simple.
US opening the application and we're going to see that and you can see that we have used the areas to
store the user name and password from the fixture, this one.
And then it is going to perform appears Snapshot, which is going to be for the visual testing, and
then it's going to perform the clicking of the employee, which is nothing but profound or there.
And then it's going to perform a verification and then it's going to closed up.
Here's a snapshot from there.
That's it.
This is the only operation that is going to do and we'll see how the test is going to execute in multiple
browsers.
Very, very super simple demo.
This time I'm going to do this.
I'm just going to do an NPCs Cyprus Open.
So this way we can run the Cyprus dashboard and we'll see how we can list all the browsers which are
currently available within my machine.
All right.
So now you can see that there is a browser and you can see that it by default, it attracted the edge
sound design.
This time all these days, you might have seen only the Chrome browser being selected, but this time
this is Edge browser guys, which is pretty interesting for some reason.
I don't know why I couldn't see the Firefox.
You can see that I have the Firefox and developer edition stuff, but still it is not displayed in my
machine.
I'm not sure about that.
But yes, you can actually see the Firefox additions and Mac operating system if you have a Mac machine,
but the browser is currently not shown in my machine, as I told you earlier.
So I'm just going to run the test in the Chrome browser this time just to make sure our existing tests
are running in the Chrome browser without any problem.
So you can see that it has open and you can see that logo is currently a Chrome logo there.
All right, you can see that the application has been loaded and it is performing the intended operation
there.
And it's running the Piercey check, and that's the reason it's taking a little bit time there.
And again, it's taking the snapshot and they're descending to the Piercey, that's it.
So you can see that it performed all the operation for us in the Chrome browser, which is pretty much
expected.
We know how it works.
So which is pretty cool.
So I'm just going to close the Chrome browser, this time on for the first time in the course.
And at least in the Cypress, we are going to run the test in the Edge browser.
So if I run the same test on the Edge browser, so I'm just going to run the app to respect our jazz.
And you can see that this time the logo is actually of the Microsoft Edge browser.
So it's not Chrome anymore.
Guys, you can see it is actually Microsoft Edge.
So this is going to run the test on the Microsoft Edge browser this time.
And you can see that it is currently visiting the website, pretty much like how it did for the Chrome
browser.
And the same behavior just pretty awesome.
Very interesting, you can see that Cyprus is now supporting two engines all together, so we know already
that Microsoft Chrome is actually acromion project.
So basically it is at a core, it's a chromium rendering engine.
So Chrome and Microsoft's Chrome are both same.
That's fine.
But Firefox is a completely different engine and it is also being supported by Cyprus.
And Cyprus team has also mentioned that they will be supporting the Safari and Internet Explorer and
pretty soon they have that in the roadmap.
But currently those two browsers are not supported.
But these are the browsers currently being supported, like Firefox and then Chrome and electronic,
just pretty cool.
So now that we can run the test from the Cyprus dashboard.
So I'm just going to close this guy.
And now if I want to run them in a command line fashion, so what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to do in Cyprus run of hyphen hyphen browser, and then I'm just going to run the browser.
So if I just type the edge and if I hit enter, you can see that it is going to open the browser again
and then it is going to run the test for us.
There you go.
You can see that it is again running the test on the edge browser for us, and you can see that it's
currently running the test on the S9 browser for running all those tests, which is pretty awesome.
And similarly, it also runs the test on the Firefox and the Chrome browser, if you have.
But if I just let me just stop this.
As of now, I'm not running the test.
So it's currently running our test in the headless model.
So I'm just going to terminate it.
So let's say if I want to run this in the Firefox browser, which is currently not detected by the Cyprus
inside in my machine.
So let's see what error that we get.
So it says that the browser Firefox was not found in your system and it only says that the available
browsers are like chrome edge, an electron.
So for some reason, the Firefox is not found.
But yes, Cyprus does support Firefox, as I already told you.
So this is how we can actually run the browser testing with Cyprus.
And this is the one that the team has mentioned here, like introducing the support for Cyprus forward.
Oh, with Crossroads testing.
And that is the crossroads, the testing guide, which is kind of very informative.
And it says some important stuff, like whatever that we have discussed here is already there.
But also they have insisted a lot about CIAs scheduling against protection for Firefox.
So they now always say that there is a workflow along with how you specify the browsers and also you
can specify the browser with the parallel option as well.
So if you come all the way down here, you can see that it is currently in execution mode.
And also the parallelism is two.
And the panel execution is also supported by the Firefox and the Chrome and the Chrome with Cyperus
in the CD pipeline.
So if you're talking about the panel execution stuff in the CD pipeline in our upcoming videos, but
as of now, this is how we can execute the cross browser testing with Cyprus, with Cyprus for our own.
Pretty exciting.
And I hope you'll really enjoy the latest flavor of Cyprus with the cross browser testing support.
So, once again, thank you very much for watching this video and have a great day.
