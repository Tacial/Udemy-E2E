// Section 17: Cypress 5.0 

Hi, guys, welcome back.
Today, we're going to talk about an all new feature images released by Cypress.
Find out today on automatic reliability or failed test cases.
This is one of the most advanced or most requested feature by testing community, which also reduce
a lot of burden of testers.
Cyprus already have many, many features, which distinguishes itself from other automation testing
tools like protractor, puppeteer, selenium or T-square or maybe playwrite.
Cyprus has many such features.
And Cyprus by default.
If you have already used that to play around with that tool, you might have seen that any assertion
which Cyprus has got has automatic rating within itself.
So if you used the should method, it automatically waits for the method to compete or identify.
The limit is already available.
They already have the debating mechanism, if you use expect that it already has such rating mechanism.
So all these things are already there within Cyprus by default, so that there are cases where you might
need to wait for the element to be available and then perform.
The assertion Cyprus has is already very, very long time before.
So, I mean, the initial list of Cyprus, while I was releasing the course, it's already there by
default.
But now this additional reliability feature of Cyprus is really, really cool because just think how
many times you might be rerunning the same failed Deskins again and again to see if that test case is
passing on, not because you automation is almost always fragile.
We know that sometimes the element may not be appearing because of the slow network or the bandwidth
issue, or maybe the application may be pretty, pretty slow because of many different reasons.
So if we have a little ability feature in that particular place where you can see that this particular
element is already available, just try to retry automatically and see that element is now available
so that you can perform a click operation.
I mean, we can write that logic already within the code, but Cyprus has this feature out of the box
within Cyprus.
And this is one of the exciting features, I would say.
So as that said, as you can see or hear, Cyprus retries are this is giving us more control over the
failed test cases and reducing the babysitting operation for us, which is a really, really code.
And all we have to do to add this feature within our existing tax code is to update Cyprus to find out
more and add this to Lime's.
As you can see in here, when it's run more, ask one or whatever that you want and then open Moedas
for.
So what does that mean?
So if you're going to run the Cyprus on the command line, which is nothing but run mode, you can specify
how many times you need to wait for that particular element to appear.
So if you want to wait or retry for like two or three time, then you can specify one or two whatever
number that you want.
And if you want to run that in the Cyprus dashboard operation, which is Cyprus open, which is something
but the Cyprus open that we used to do, if we do this way, then you can also specify the viability
of that particular mode as well, which is the open mode of one are open for that.
You can specify, as you can see in here, in the configuration.
So this is super, super easy.
All you have to do is just add these two configuration and you are pretty good to go with the new feature.
That's it.
And I can probably show you how the old UI off the dashboard and the new UI of the dashboard is going
to look like basically it's going to look something like this.
As you can see in here, it's going to fail the test like this.
And this is the old one.
I mean, until four, nine or something like that.
And later, starting today, if we update to Cyprus, find out or you will have the UI, something like
this, as you can see, it is going to show you the attempt of the failures and it is going to perform
the same attempt like four times that I have specified.
And then it's going to fail gracefully, saying that this is something I cannot even really, really
attempt to make this to pass.
So that is like four items happening on Cyprus side, and it's trying to verify if this text Prashanth
is already available on that particular UI.
Yeah, so this is it.
This is the only super simple thing which you can do with the new reliability.
I mean, pretty straightforward.
This is the required feature and it is already there in Cyprus.
So quickly see everything in action and understand how things work so far that I'm going to show you
my existing project with the old Cyprus forward six era.
And then I'm going to show you the new Cyprus file at all with the reliability feature.
So jump into my machine's screen right now.
All right.
As you can see now, I have Cyprus for.
Not six over here, and then I'm just going to do a Cyprus open, which is nothing but the NBCs of Cyprus
open, and once I do that, it is going to open my existing accord lauded on the Cyprus dashboard.
So if you can see over here, I have an integration folder and then I have goombah desk.
And I also have some of the test, which is very, very specific to the Cyprus functionality itself.
There you go.
So now we have the Cyprus for our six loaded and it has all the tests being listed, which is available
on my framework or maybe my code.
And if you can see in here, I can run my test.
I think about the appart Specter Dargis, which was the one which I was showing on the slide.
And it is going to run pretty much exactly like how it has to run.
But this particular test is going to fail.
Looking for a text prashanth SS, which is completely not available on the UI, so it is just going
to fail.
That's it.
So there is no way that I can really specify or mention in this test that wait for like three or four
time or retire for three or four times to see that particular text exist.
And if that particular text exists then try to perform an operation.
So I don't really have a mechanism to do that.
As you can see that this test is going to start running.
It's also going to do some Piercey health check there.
So I have already configured the procedure for visual testing and then you can see that it is going
to verify the text containing parentheses.
But that particular text doesn't really exist.
It has something the patient, but not Prashanth says it's told the test has now got failed, which
is pretty bad.
And we can, of course, see the console output of this error and all those things.
And which file ask me, are those that are these are some of the features we already know available
in Cyprus.
That's all right.
But if you go to the random settings on the configuration on this particular version of Cyprus, we
don't really have retries configuration itself because this is the old version of the new version,
which I was talking about.
If I just open the new project, which I have already updated this to show you the demonstration so
you can see that we have this NPK Cyprus open.
But before that, you can see that within the Cyprus start jasen file, I have added this retries over
here.
So this retries tells me that how many numbers we decided to make on the run mod and how many number
of retries I need to make on the open.
So now it is something I have specified already in the test and now I have already updated the Cyprus
file.
Oh, so if you can see in my cach√© on the local Cyprus, you can see that I have Firat already updated
just today in the morning.
And now that the Cyprus is going to open, the file out of Cyprus is going to open.
And you can see that this is looking like pretty much exactly like how it has to look in our earlier
version.
And now if I just try to open the Abdah Specter just.
If I tried to run the test this time, you can see that it is going to lower the test and it's going
to run the test for me and we'll see how many time it now try to retry and perform the attempt to run
this particular test.
And you can see that it is trying to atone for the fifth time as well.
So that this guy this is the real power of the udemy, so does this guy.
This is the new feature of Cyprus Virata.
You can also do exactly the same thing if you try to run this from the command line.
So if I just try to run this on the NPK, Cyprus run off Speck of envy name is going to.
So I have created my own custom configurations to specify what config which I'm running, which environment
I'm actually going to run in the environment or the environment or staging environment.
I have specified that I can also specify the browser here, like Chrome or Firefox, something like
that.
And once I specify everything over there, then I'm going to run the test on the command line as well.
And you can see that this time it is going to wait only for one time.
So it should be just one instead of two items.
So let's see what's going to basically happen.
So it's currently executing the test for us.
And you can see that this diamond is also making two atoms, basically saying atomic number two, I
think there is some zero in this problem on the existing or the current version of the Cyprus file at
all.
Maybe they fix it in five point zero.
That one's a hard fix.
But, yes, it proves the point that it actually works for both the Cyprus run as well as the Cyprus
open letter.
Guys, this is the new feature of Cyprus.
I'm pretty excited to see this new feature is really going to bring a lot of value to existing DISCUSES
once again.
Thank you.
I was watching this video and have a great day.
